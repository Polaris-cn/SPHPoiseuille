# SPHPoiseuille

Java code for simulating Couette and Poiseuille flows using SPH. The data is outputted as ParaView files. ParaView is an open-source data analysis and visualization program and is available at http://www.paraview.org/.

## Getting Started
Edit the `SPHPoiseuille.java` file with your required input setting currently you are able to set:
Smoothing length
Mass of particle
Speed of sound in the fluid
Time step
Acceleration due to gravity
Kinematic viscosity of fluid
Velocity of plate at x=BOX_WIDTH

Set the initial box size using `GenerateParticles.java`

## Notes
Used for my undergraduate disseration
